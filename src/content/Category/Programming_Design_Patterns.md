## Programming Design Patterns
- **Reusable** - named blueprints you can drop into many designs
- **Repeatable** - solve the same core problem across projects
- **Contextual** - apply only when a specific situation and constraints exist
- **Clear Trade-offs** - spell out exactly what you gain and what are the costs
- **Scale-friendly** - their payoff grows as the codebase grows

- **Facade** – Simplifies the interface of a set of classes.
- **Proxy** – Wraps an object to control access to it.
- **Template Method** – Subclasses decide how to implement steps in an algorithm.
- **Abstract Factory** – Allows a client to create families of objects without specifying their concrete classes.
