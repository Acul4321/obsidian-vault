# Data Link Layer
access to the physical layer.
- identify devices - addressing 
- structure and frame the raw bitstream
- Detect and correct bit errors
- Control access to the channel
#### Interface with Layer 1([[Physical_Layer|Physical Layer]])
- raw bitstream
#### Interface with Layer 3([[Network_Layer|Network Layer]])
- structured communication (addressing, packets)

### Basic Services
#### Addressing
- Physical links can be point-to-point or multi-access
#### Framing and synchronisation
