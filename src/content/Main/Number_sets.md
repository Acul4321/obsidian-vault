# Number sets
In mathematics, there are several standard **number sets** that are frequently used for variables in expressions and statements. such as:
- Natural Numbers($\mathbb{N}$)
	- **Definition**: The set of all positive whole numbers starting from 0 or 1.
	- **Notation**: $\mathbb{N}$ = {${0,1,2,3,\dots}$}*(most of the time)*
- Whole Numbers($\mathbb{W}$ or $\mathbb{N}_{0}$)
	- **Definition**: Includes all non-negative integers (i.e. the natural numbers plus ${0}$).
	- **Notation**: $\mathbb{W}$ = {$0,1,2,3,\dots$}
- Integers($\mathbb{Z}$)
	- **Definition**:The set of all positive and negative whole numbers, including 0.
	- **Notation**: $\mathbb{Z} = \{ \dots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\dots \}$ 
- Rational Numbers($\mathbb{Q}$)
	- **Definition**: The set of all numbers that can be expressed as a fraction $\frac{a}{b}$ , where ${a} \text{ and } {b} \in \mathbb{Z}$ and ${b} \\\neq 0$ 
	- **Notation**: $\mathbb{Q}$ = {${\frac{a}{b}}\mid{a,b}\in\mathbb{Z},b\neq {0}$}, Encompasses all numbers that have finite or repeating decimal expansions.
- Irrational Numbers
	- **Definition**: Numbers that cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers (non-repeating, non-terminating decimals).
	- **Notation**: There isnâ€™t a standard single-letter notation for irrationals, but they are typically considered the complement of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$.
	- **Examples**: $\sqrt{2}$, $\pi$, $e$.
- Real Numbers($\mathbb{R}$)
	- **Definition**: The set of all rational and irrational numbers; essentially, any number that can be located on a continuous number line.
	- **Notation**: $\mathbb{R}$.
- Complex numbers($\mathbb{C}$)
	- **Definition**: The set of all numbers that can be expressed in the form $a+bi$, where$a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i$ is the imaginary unit($i^2=-1$).
	- **Notation**: $\mathbb{C}$ = {$a+bi\mid {a,b}\in \mathbb{R}$}.

### **Subset Notations and Extensions**
we can get the subset of these number sets by adding some symbols:
- Positive subset ($\mathbb{Z^+}$)
	- all positive numbers in the set
- Negative subset ($\mathbb{Z^-}$)
	- all negative numbers in the set
- conditional subset ($\mathbb{Z}_{\geq_{0}}$) **Not actual name**
	- all numbers that fit the condition in the set
