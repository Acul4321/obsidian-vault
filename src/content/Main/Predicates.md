# Predicates
a Boolean function i.e. returns either **True** or **False**.
allows construction of [[Propositions]] which include variables.

**predicates** become [[Compound_Propositions]] if:
- variables are assigned values
- variables are bound with values from its domain through [[Quantifiers]].

In the **predicate** ${P(y)}$ the variable y is **free** or **unbound**:
- the value of y is not yet specified
