# Protocol Layers
Organizes communication systems into a series of layers to simplify network design and functionality.
#### Layer Structure 
- Each layer provides services to the layer above it using well-defined interfaces
- Highest layer: the communicating application
- Lowest layer: the physical communication channel

### OSI Reference Model ^[Open Systems Interconnection Model]
A conceptual framework used to understand and implement network communication between different systems.
It divides the networking process into seven distinct layers, each with specific functions and protocols.
