# Quantifiers
There are two types of **quantifiers**:
- $\forall$ (universal) -  asserts that a property holds for all values of a variable in a given domain
- $\exists$ (existential) - asserts that a property holds for some values of a variable in a given domain

variables can are **bound** through **Quantifiers**.
*if a quantifier does not bind any variables it can be removed, quantifiers can only bind in its scope*

when nesting quantifiers the order matters.

## Universe of discourse
sometimes also know as the **domain of discourse**
if we have a [[Propositions|proposition]]:
$$\forall{x}.{P(x)}$$
the variable $x$ is quantified by $\forall$, which means "for all $x$ in the universe of discourse."
The universe of discourse can represent any domain, such as:
- all people
- all animals
- [[Number_sets]] and or [[sets]]
