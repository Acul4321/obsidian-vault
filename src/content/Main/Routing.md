# Routing
Network layer responsible for routing data from source to destination across multiple hops.
## Routing Types:
### Static Routing
involves manually configuring routing tables with fixed routes. These routes do not change unless manually updated by a network administrator.
- Predefined routes
- lacks flexibility
- requires maintenance
- lacks scalability.
### Dynamic Routing
uses protocols to automatically discover and maintain routing information. 
Routers exchange information to adjust routes based on network conditions.
- Adjusts routes based on network changes.
## Routing Protocols
### Inter-domain Unicast Routing
Routing data between different autonomous systems.

### intra-domain Unicast Routing
Routing data within a single autonomous system.
### Distance Vector Protocol
### link state Routing 
##### Terminology
Network topology^[*Network topology*: The arrangement or layout of different elements (nodes, links) in a computer network.]
Hop^[*Hop*: A step in the journey from source to destination, where data is passed from one network device (like a router) to another.]
Gateway device^[*Gateway devices*: Routers that connect different networks and direct data packets between them, determining the best path for data to reach its destination.]
