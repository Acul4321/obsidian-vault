# Binary Tree
A binary tree is a linked data structure in which each *node* x has an attribute *key* and *three pointer* attributes
- *x.p* points to its parent
- *x.left* points to its left child
- *x.right* points to its right child
- The root of the tree is the only node whose parent is NIL
- Node *x* is a leaf when `x.left = x.right = NIL`
Given a tree T
- *T.root* points to the root element of tree *T*
- If `T.root = NIL`, the tree is *empty*

The *height (h)* of a tree is the length of the *longest* path from the root
These trees can be [[traversal]] in different ways.

| Left subtree         | Right subtree                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| ![[leftSubtree.png]] | ![[rightSubtree.png]] |

Path from *3* to *6*:
- 3,7,1,6 = length 3

## Balanced trees
a *balanced* binary tree is a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than *1*
- Height $O(log n)$

## k-array trees
Trees with a *bounded* number of children (*k-array trees*) can be easily represented with additional pointer attributes $child_{1} , â€¦, child_{k}$ 
### Limitations 
- A lot of *NIL* values if many nodes have less than *k* children
- *k* is fixed (it needs to be known in advance)

## unbounded branching
Trees with an *unbounded* number of children can easily be represented with additional attributes
- *x.left-child* points to the leftmost child of *x*
- *x.right-sibling* points to the sibling of *x* immediately to its right
### Limitations
- Accessing a child is *O(k)* as we need to scan all the list of children to access the rightmost child
- *k* is the maximum branch degree
