# Recursion

A function is **recursive** if it refers to itself in its definition.
When calling itself, a recursive function makes a *clone* and calls the clone with appropriate parameters.
A recursive algorithm must always:
- reduce size of data set, or the number its working on, each time it is recursively called
- provide a stopping case (*terminating condition*)

Recursion has a **cost** - The memory usage to keep track of the state of each recursive call
*Non-recursive* algorithm are also called *iterative*

## Recursion Visualization
### Recursive Trace
Graphical method to visualize the execution of recursive algorithms
Drawn as follows: 
- A box for each recursive call
- An arrow from each caller to callee (in black)
- An arrow from each callee to caller showing return value (in blue) (we will often omit this)
```python title:Fact(4)
Fact(n):
	if n == 1:
		return 1
	else:
		return n * Fact(n-1)
# highly inefficent only for demonstation purposes
```

### Recursion Tree
Visualizing each recursive call in an algorithm using *binary recursion* results in a (binary) *recursion tree*
- The number of nodes $n$ in a full binary tree is at most $n = 2h+1 - 1$ where $h$ is the height of the tree

## Types of Recursive functions
### Linear Recursion
linear recursion a method is defined so that it makes at most *one recursive call* each time it is invoked.
The amount of space needed to keep track of the nested calls, *grows linearly* withÂ *n*

### Tail Recursion
An algorithm uses tail recursion when recursion is linear and recursive call is its very last operation
Algorithms using tail recursion can be converted to a non-recursive algorithm by iterating through recursive calls rather than calling them explicitly

### Binary Recursion
When an algorithm makes *two* recursive calls, we say that it uses *binary recursion*
```python title:Fib(n)
def Fib(n):
	if n <= 1:
		return n
	else:
		return Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2)
```
