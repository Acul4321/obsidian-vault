# State Pattern
## What
Encapsulates state-based behaviors and uses delegation to switch between behaviors.
## When
An objectâ€™s behavior depends on its internal state, and it must change its behavior at runtime depending on that state.
An object changes behavior based on internal state using conditionals.
```java
public class MusicPlayer {
    String state = "STOPPED";
    public void pressPlay() {
        if (state.equals("STOPPED")) state = "PLAYING";
        else if (state.equals("PLAYING")) state = "PAUSED";
        else state = "PLAYING";
    }
}
```
## How
- Define a `State` interface with behavior-specific methods.
- Implement concrete state classes.
- The context object holds a reference to a state instance and delegates behavior to it.#
```java
interface State { void pressPlay(MusicPlayer player); }

class PlayingState implements State {
    public void pressPlay(MusicPlayer p) { System.out.println("Pause"); p.setState(new PausedState()); }
}
class PausedState implements State {
    public void pressPlay(MusicPlayer p) { System.out.println("Play"); p.setState(new PlayingState()); }
}

class MusicPlayer {
    private State state = new PausedState();
    public void setState(State state) { this.state = state; }
    public void pressPlay() { state.pressPlay(this); }
}

```
## Examples
- TCP connection handling (e.g., Open, Closed, Listening states).
- Media player controls (e.g., Playing, Paused, Stopped states).
## Why
### Advantages
- Eliminates large conditional statements for state transitions.
- Promotes separation of concerns and cleaner state-specific behavior.
- Easier to add new states without changing existing logic.
### Disadvantages
- Increases number of classes.
- Tight coupling between context and state classes.
